/**
 * Transforms a type into its canonical (standard) representation.
 *
 * In TypeScript, there are multiple ways to represent the same type shapeâ€”especially
 * when dealing with optional properties. For example, an optional property declared as:
 *
 *   id?: string;
 *
 * is internally equivalent to a property of type `string | undefined`, though their
 * representations may differ when compared directly.
 *
 * By canonicalizing a type, this utility recursively traverses its structure and ensures
 * that every property that might be optional is explicitly represented as a union with
 * `undefined`. This normalization converts different syntactic representations (such as
 * optional shorthand or intersections) into the same standard form, making type equality
 * checks (using utilities like `IsEqual`) more reliable.
 *
 * @template T - The type to canonicalize.
